Hi! I'm not quite to the point of "publicizing," but if you stumbled here, this is my Unity project creating a mobile game that trains your ability to read and type in Japanese. 
This game doubles to teach you entirely how to read Hiragana, Katakana, and many basic kanji as they are present in the JLPT N5 standards.
